WHAT ELSE SHOULD I HAVE DONE?

1. Created the Git repo and uploaded the code

2. Added a lot more unit tests

3. Implemented mocking properly

4. Documented the code properly and in much more detail with docstrings

5. Added more analysis of the data including looking at the quality of it and whether anything was missing

6. Dealt with the api-key more robustly rther than hard-coding it. Maybe used Pudantic's secret string and possibly kept it in a separate config file
